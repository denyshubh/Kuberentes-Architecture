# Provisioning Compute Resources

Kubernetes requires a set of machines to host the Kubernetes control plane and the worker nodes where containers are ultimately run. In this lab you will provision the compute resources required for running a secure and highly available Kubernetes cluster across a single Region (US-EAST).


### Networking:

The Kubernetes networking model assumes a flat network in which containers and nodes can communicate with each other. In cases where this is not desired *network policies* can limit how groups of containers are allowed to communicate with each other and external network endpoints.

### Virtual Network:
1. virtual network name - kubernetes-the-hard-way
2. CIDR Range - 10.240.0.0/16 
<!-- A subnet must be provisioned with an IP address range large enough to assign a private IP address to each node in the Kubernetes cluster -->

3. subnet name - kubernetes
4. subnet range - 10.240.0.0/24

### Firewall Rules:
Create Two Security Groups
1. name: kubernetes-the-hard-way-allow-internal 
   allow: tcp, udp, icmp
   source-ranges: 10.240.0.0/24

2. name: kubernetes-the-hard-way-allow-external
   allow: tcp:22, tcp:6443, icmp
   source-range: 0.0.0.0/0

### Compute Instances
- Deploys 5 VMs - 2 Master, 2 Worker and 1 Loadbalancer

- Set's IP addresses in the range 10.240.0.*

    | VM            |  VM Name               | Purpose       | IP           | 
    | ------------  | ---------------------- |:-------------:| ------------:| 
    | master-1      | controller-0           | Master        | 10.240.0.10  | 
    | master-2      | controller-1           | Master        | 10.240.0.11  | 
    | worker-1      | worker-0               | Worker        | 10.240.0.20  | 
    | worker-2      | worker-1               | Worker        | 10.240.0.21  | 
    | loadbalancer  | kubernetes-lb          | LoadBalancer  | 10.240.0.30  |
